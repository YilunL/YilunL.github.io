                        semester.
                        I have hand picked the ones shown, these represent slightly more than half of all comments I

                        received - even the ones not displayed are overwhelmingly positive. These are anonymous quotes
                        directly
                        from the Instructor Evaluation reports; I have not edited any of them!</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"The excellence in TAs redefined what education can be at Penn. Although this class was a lot
                            of work, it was by far my favorite class this semester. Yes,
                            there was a lot of complaining and groaning, but if every class was like this one studying
                            would be a lot more enjoyable."

                        <li>
                            "Everyone knows that Ivan is an amazing TA, and I am not at all surprised that he lived up to his reputation. Not only does he genuinely care about his
                            students and their performance, but he also understands what it is like to be an undergraduate and especially an undergraduate in this course. His
                            resources, recitations, and general advice was incredibly helpful and definitely improved my performance in the course. I was incredibly lucky to have him as
                            my TA, and I'm sad to see him go but he definitely left a great impact and set a precedent for Penn's math department and Penn TAs."

                        <li>
                            "Ivan and Nibby are the GOATs and I will miss them a lot next year when they leave. They hold plentiful office hours and are always open to helping us
                            students and it is mostly through them that I was able to do okay in the course."

                            Ivan was always accessible and easy to reach, and I had no difficulties whenever I had

                            helpful, and I would have done so
                            much worse in this course without him and all of the resources he provides."

                            uploaded for the students to
                            access because it helped me go back to something I might have not completely understood
                            during
                            lecture. I also appreciated that he gave very thorough review sessions because they were
                            extremely
                            helpful for studying for exams."

                            course concepts. He exceeds any and all of my expectations."

                            disorganized lecture. Ivan was very
                            accessible outside of class, and he responded to emails within a few minutes, and I was able
                            to schedule meetings to go over midterms, practice problems, and just general questions
                            about
                            concepts multiple times. When I felt completely lost in lecture (which was most of the
                            time),
                            Ivan helped make the concepts easier and stimulated my interest when I was no longer
                            interested
                            in the subject because of how much I was struggling. He goes above and beyond through his
                            videos
                            on his webiste, extra extensive review sessions, and being available at all times."

                            office hours, recitations, review
                            sessions, and much more. His videos really helped to solidify my understanding of the topic
                            and
                            I feel so lucky to have ended up having him as a TA because I don't think I would've enjoyed
                            the class as much or learned as much had it not been for him."

                            "After taking this course, I think it's safe to say that a new statue should be erected
                            outside DRL which bears the name
                            of Ivan Li."

                        <li>
                            "Ivan Li was an unbelievable TA. The amount of time that he put into recitation materials,
                            holding review sessions, answering
                            questions, etc. helped me to understand the material clearly and to study effectively. I do
                            not
                            know what I would have done without Ivan as a TA. Many points of the lectures became
                            confusing,
                            and Ivan always had a clear and concise way to explain the topics. I cannot thank Ivan
                            enough
                            for his dedication to help us learn. The best TA I have ever had at Penn by far."
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            "IVAN LI IS THE GOD OF MATHEMATICS. I love that he goes above and beyond for his students,
                            providing material in the form
                            of videos posted on his website. He also provides us with additional problems (and solutions
                            to refer back to) whenever we have exams. I think he does an awesome job of explaining
                            concepts
                            that would otherwise be difficult to process. I'm so glad I got him as a TA this semester!"

                            He singlehandedly
                            is the reason I passed / learned this course and was absolutely amazing."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan has taught me two semesters of Calculus at penn. Less than 10 students attend lecture
                            because
                            no one can understand the professor, but Ivan is able to teach the curriculum in only 50
                            minutes
                            each week."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is AMAZING! He is always accessible outside of class, either in person or through
                            email/Piazza.
                            His notes were very helpful and prior to all exams, he held review sessions where he went
                            over
                            problems that we needed to know for that particular exam. He is very patient and kind and I
                            can
                            confidently say that I learned and understood material from this course only because of his
                            guidance
                            and teaching."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was simply incredible. I usually don't attend office hours for any class, but I
                            emailed Ivan
                            often because I knew that not only would I get a prompt and accurate response, but that he
                            would
                            go above and beyond in helping me understand. Just before the final I asked for help on a
                            Pimsner
                            problem. Ivan (accurately) informed me that we had not covered that topic, but also
                            highlighted
                            what I should take away from that problem anyway. He is simply excellent!"</li>
                        <li>"Due to the poor communication of the professor, many of the students in this class (myself
                            included)
                            only show up for recitation with Ivan (Yilun). He teaches the class in a much more
                            understandable
                            and manageable way than the actual professor, so much that other students from other
                            sections
                            of the class (with different professors) come to his review sessions because he teaches the
                            content
                            so clearly and with such poise and confidence. I literally only am passing this class
                            because
                            of Ivan. He has put in so much time and energy to provide his students with extra material
                            like
                            practice quizzes, answers to practice problems, review packets, recitation notes, and even
                            an
                            85 page notes packet. Ivan is an incredible TA, when I heard he was going to be my TA I knew
                            that my life taking this class would be easier."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is an amazing TA. His teaching is always clear, concise, and to the point."</li>
                        <li>"The TA went above and beyond to help us learn the material - he has even created a website
                            and posts
                            lesson videos for us."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan filled the void in my knowledge left by challenging lectures and opaque office hours
                            with Prof.
                            Chai. Recitations largely replaced lectures. I came to truly grasp and understand the
                            material
                            in Ivan's office hours. Study sessions held by Ivan filled classrooms while more and more
                            students
                            abandoned lectures. Ivan's website made accessing notes, videos, and practice quizzes for
                            this
                            class trivial. Ivan quickly and effectively responds to questions on Piazza. Even when Ivan
                            hits
                            rough patches in his unthinkably busy schedule, he still makes time to teach and answer
                            questions
                            for his student. Ivan raises the bar for all TA's and is inspiring as a student and a
                            teacher."</li>
                        <li>"Learned the entire course from his great recitations. Ivan spends a lot of time preparing
                            material
                            for his recitations and review sessions. He is truly, an amazing teacher and TA. I took the
                            course
                            with Chai, despite his reputation, so I can have Ivan as my TA. Great and hardworking
                            individual."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was an amazing TA!! His recitations were filled with many useful examples, which
                            helped clarify
                            what we learned in lecture and prepared us to answer similar homework questions. He always
                            went
                            above and beyond to help us. I joined this class a week or two into the semester, and he was
                            very accommodating with catching me up on assignments and helping me get used to the
                            material.
                            He had plenty of weekly (sometimes even daily) office hours, review sessions before exams,
                            and
                            was constantly answering our questions via Piazza. He also responded quickly to emails. He
                            also
                            updated his website frequently with his personal notes, extra supplemental examples, videos,
                            etc. He was a fair grader and helped me understand my mistakes. I definitely feel like I
                            would
                            not have been able to succeed in this class without having him as my TA. He was somewhat
                            apologetic
                            that this was his first time as a TA for Math 240, but it certainly did not show, since he
                            did
                            a fantastic job!"</li>
                        <li>"IVANNNNNNN. YOU'RE AWESOME. SAVED MY LIFE IN MATH 240. I CONSIDERED YOU TO BE MY PROFESSOR"
                        </li>
                        <li>"IVAN LI SHOULD TEACH MATH 240 (and 114). Although I was unhappy to be stuck with Chai as my
                            professor,
                            I knew I was going to be ok because Ivan was my TA. I honestly had to remind myself that
                            Ivan
                            was also a student and not just our TA because he put much more time, effort and care into
                            our
                            class than Chai did. Ivan would stay an hour to an hour and a half past his designated
                            office
                            hour times to help us finish our math homework and make sure we understood the material. I
                            am
                            upset I will not be having him as a TA next semester because he has made the most
                            significant
                            positive impact on my math experience at Penn. I hope he goes on to teach because he has a
                            gift
                            for it and should put many of the math professors at Penn out of jobs (or teach them how to
                            be
                            teachers)."
                        </li>
                        <li>"This TA was better than the teacher. I had him last semester for Math 114 too, and he
                            continues
                            to be amazing! He is the only reason I actually learned anything this semester. He will be a
                            great professor someday"</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is the best TA there is, perhaps better than the professors with PHDs. If I have
                            learned anything
                            from Penn Math, it is from Ivan. Penn needs to find more TAs like Ivan, or have Ivan."</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>"Ivan was honestly a shining star in this class. I know he's only a TA, but he's probably
                            the best
                            instructor I had my freshmen year."</li>
                        <li>"He's an amazing TA. He taught me much better than the teacher did, answered my questions
                            much more
                            effectively, held a lot of review sessions, answered questions on Piazza quickly and is very
                            likeable."
                        </li>
                        <li>"Lectures were not the best way to learn the content for this course, but Ivan did a really
                            amazing
                            job going over everything that we needed to know. Math clearly isn't my strong suit, but
                            Ivan
                            took a lot of time to answer my question during office hours, as well as just provide a
                            positive
                            environment to learn. I was really intimated by my peers, and even though Ivan is pretty
                            much
                            a genius, he's still very approachable and encouraging. Thank you for a great sem!"</li>
                        <li>"Ivan did more for the students in the class than the professor. He conducted review
                            sessions, gave
                            review lectures on Fridays, and had a website where he posted notes and practice problems.
                            He
                            was always available and TRULY cared about us as students and individuals. Penn should do
                            everything
                            in its power to keep Ivan in the math department as long as possible."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan dragged us through Heaven and Earth in order to make sure we understood the material.
                            This
                            recitation was infinitely more valuable than the lecture and I cannot stress that enough."
                        </li>
                        <li>"Ivan went above and beyond to ensure that students (and sometimes not even his student)
                            were learning
                            to material. The material he provided in addition to the extra review sessions that he has,
                            and
                            the extra office hours have overall helped my ability to learn in the class. During office
                            hours,
                            students had the opportunity to learn one on one with Ivan, going through practice problems,
                            and he typically did a great job of teaching the material in a way where everyone could
                            learn
                            it. Overall, I'm highly impressed with Ivan's dedication to his students."</li>
                        <li>"I couldn't have survived through this course without Ivan. He invested so much time and
                            effort to
                            make course content more manageable and understandable through recitations, Friday review
                            sessions,
                            office hours, exam review sessions. He also had a Piazza page which was such a nice way for
                            us
                            to ask questions to both him and fellow classmates. He was always so responsive to questions
                            and messages despite him having a heavier schedule than most. He has inspired me so much
                            about
                            selﬂessness and putting others before yourself. I hope to follow in his steps one day to
                            also
                            become a TA for a class (maybe this class) because he was so so so amazing. I have nothing
                            but
                            praise for Ivan."</li>
                        <li>"The TA was probably the best teacher that I have had out of all of my teachers at Penn. He
                            went
                            out of his way to help us, and even held 2.5 hour Friday review sessions every single week
                            to
                            go over the weekly lectures, in addition to his recitation. He also compiled an entire book
                            of
                            notes for his students, which have been extremely useful. He also created a piazza page and
                            answered
                            any question that we had about the course within 20 minutes of asking. He made math fun, and
                            he actually cared about whether or not we learned something."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was the only reason that I passed Math 114. His review sessions were so incredibly
                            helpful,
                            and he was always willing to explain topics no matter how many times I asked. He also had an
                            extremely active Piazza page that he used to answer questions even when he wasn't in office
                            hours.
                            The only reason I feel confident taking Math 240 is because Ivan is planning to TA that
                            class."</li>
                        <li>"The best TA out there, I think everyone will agree. Thank you Ivan! As someone who wants to
                            be an
                            educator myself, I have the utmost respect for your style and just genuine interest in your
                            students'
                            success. It's a rare skill and a rare passion. I wish you all the best! I hope my comments
                            are
                            helpful in any way." </li>
                        <li>"Ivan Li was the only reason that the course was manageable for most students. He gave up a
                            lot of
                            his own time and effort outside of recitation (holding extended office hours, having extra
                            lectures
                            of his own, answering emails and piazza questions) to make up for the lack of instruction by
                            the professor."</li>
                        <li>"The TA essentially taught this class as lecture was useless. James Haglund would use
                            Rimmer's Powerpoint
                            slides that he had never seen before until that day, and was ineffective at communicating
                            the
                            course material. Many things on the final exam Haglund never discussed. Yilun is the only
                            reason
                            many students learned anything in this class."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan taught much better and much more successfully than the actual professor. If Ivan was
                            the professor
                            the class would actually learn material."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is the best TA you'll ever have. Seriously he does so much for his kids. If you have
                            him, it
                            doesn't matter how difficult the class or teacher is. He'll help you enough."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan Li is probably the best TA that has ever existed and is the only reason I learned
                            anything

                            who has gone above and beyond the call of duty in any endeavor like Ivan Li. To begin, Ivan
                            began
                            doing optional shadow lectures of Haglund on Fridays, where he would review the entire
                            week's
                            materials. Second, his website posts so much relevant information and resources. His LaTex

                            document, which is over 100 pages long, was more helpful in this course that Haglund's
                            lectures,
                            MyMathLab, AND the Godzilla textbook combined. I cannot even express how amazed I am by
                            Ivan.
                            I would take a course just because he is TAing it. I propose that the Math Department starts
                            an annual award for the Best TA, and name it the Ivan Li award, because he deserves it. If
                            only
                            all TAs were like Ivan........."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan went above and beyond in all aspects of being a TA. Don't think I would have gotten
                            the grade
                            I did without him and I'm grateful. Overall, best TA."</li>
                        <li>"Despite the poor quality of the lecture, Yilun went above and beyond to help out each and
                            every
                            student, including those who were not even assigned to his recitations. When he saw students
                            struggling and giving up on the main lecture, he hosted a three hour review and teaching
                            session
                            each week and recorded it for students who could not make it in order to ensure that we
                            would
                            all be prepared for each final and midterm. He was incredibly accessible and quick to answer
                            emails and Piazza questions. Additionally, he worked incredibly hard to grade each of our
                            exams
                            and return them to us with impressive expedience."</li>
                        <li>"The TA was extremely devoted to finding every opportunity to help students, ranging from
                            helpful
                            Friday review sessions basically every week to a piazza page, and honestly was such a far
                            better
                            "teacher" than the professor that lecture was almost awkward seeing how poorly the professor
                            taught the course as compared to a TA who is simply another college student."</li>
                        <li>"This is the best TA at Penn. He goes the extra mile every week and was fantastic at
                            explaining the
                            concepts of multi. I think I would have failed without his help. Give this man a raise!"
                        </li>
                        <li>"Yilun is committed to make every student who shows up to his recitation to understand and
                            know the
                            material. He puts in a lot of effort in providing examples that he believes will make us
                            understand
                            chapters a lot better. I would also say he explains things in a straight forward manner
                            which
                            is great because the textbook can get very confusing when it is hard to physically grasp
                            what
                            it is saying. Overall, I would say he is the best TA you could get!"</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is absolutely the best TA/instructor in math that I have ever had. He is consistently
                            available
                            to answer student questions on Piazza even with his busy schedule and is genuinely concerned
                            with helping his students succeed. For example, he held extra Friday review sessions almost
                            every
                            week in the semester to help students practice things that they could not pick up in
                            lecture.
                            If not for Ivan , this course would have been much much harder."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was the best TA I've had. If it wasn't for him I would have dropped the class!"</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was single-handedly the reason why I did not do poorly in this class. He made the
                            material
                            more interesting and gave students of the class many opportunities to meet with him to clear
                            up any difficulties. He went above and beyond in all respects."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is actually the best. He has been committed to making sure we learn the material
                            before the
                            Final. He worked out what he should go through in the recitations to make sure we have
                            plenty
                            of time to study for the final. He even had make-up lectures on Friday afternoons to teach
                            us
                            the material since Haglund's style didn't work. Highly recommend him, so honored to be so
                            pampered
                            my freshman year."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is an incredible TA that cares about his students and is dedicated to their learning.
                            I passed
                            this class only because of his help. He held regular office hours and review sessions which
                            helped
                            me grasp material that I could not understand in lecture due to a poor professor. Ivan
                            really
                            has a great skill in teaching and catering to the needs of his students. The math department
                            is lucky to have him as a TA."
                        </li>
                        <li>"Ivan was basically the professor of this course. He hosted regular weekly extra review
                            sessions
                            to supplement the lectures and recitations. His website compiled personal notes for every
                            section
                            of every unit and presented numerous problems from past finals and midterms for review.
                            Somehow
                            he managed to function as basically a full-time math teacher while being a Junior

                            student."

                        <li>"Ivan was an amazing TA. Sometimes he taught the material better than the professor. I am
                            very lucky
                            to have had him for the course."</li>
                        <li>"I was at times frustrated that Prof Hablicsek didn't post any notes online. It was
                            difficult to
                            rely exclusively on Rimmer's notes when studying. Ivan was amazing, seriously so good."</li>
                        <li>"Absolutely amazing TA. Really helped solidify my understanding of the material."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was incredible as a TA. He seemed very passionate about math. Not only that he seemed
                            very
                            passionate about helping learn so that we could develop the level of knowledge he had about
                            Math.
                            Overall, he was an A+ TA."</li>
                        <li>"IVAN IS THE MOST AWESOME TA I'VE EVER MET. He is accountable, easy to reach out, friendly
                            and even
                            very fast in scoring. He is very clear when teaching materials for 114!!"</li>
                        <li>"Awesome TA! Really knew what he was talking about and was friendly and highly available via
                            both
                            emails and office hours."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is the best TA I've had during my time at Penn in any class."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is the only reason I know anything about 114 he is literally a godsend 1000% would
                            recommend
                            him"
                        </li>
                        <li>"Absolutely amazing TA! So accessible, patient, and helpful. Taught me everything I know
                            about math
                            114. Much more helpful than the professor himself. Would recommend Ivan (Yilun) as a TA to
                            anyone."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan's website and many many resources truly helped me learn calculus! His email responses
                            were
                            always extremely fast, and he held many office hours and review sessions for us. An amazing
                            TA!!
                            Would not have learned calculus without his help!"</li>
                        <li>"Without the help of the TA, I probably would have done much worse on exams and would have a
                            weaker
                            grasp on the content. The TA really knows how to explain the content well and answers
                            questions
                            appropriately. A very great job in helping students and being an important resource for
                            them."</li>

                            the
                            extra mile to make sure students understand."</li>
                        <li>"Most amazing TA I've had or could ever imagine having. Explained hard concepts to me in
                            ways that
                            made sense, was a great role model, and always made time for his students. Would not have
                            understood
                            the course material nearly as well without him."</li>
                        <li>"Phenomenal TA. Always available to answer my questions and did a much better job at
                            explaining the
                            material than the teacher. Highly recommend!"</li>
                        <li>"Ivan was an amazing TA. He is so intelligent and can answer questions VERY clearly. I
                            cannot imagine
                            having had a better TA. He gives not just amazing math advice but also general guidance on
                            college
                            and majors. Wonderful."</li>
                        <li>"Ivan is a fantastic TA who is able to understand a student's perspective and answer
                            questions/teach
                            material accordingly. He was very accessible outside of class and responded to emails very
                            quickly.
                            His recitations were useful for understanding the material better. I have no complaints."
